# Introduction
This experiment follows @hatipogluHandoverbasedLoadBalancing2020 to attempt to replicate their findings

# Recreating propogation loss function
In `propogation_loss.ipynb` we attempt to recreate Figure 2. As T_P and T_G are not given, I have estimated them by referencing the difference in the graphs to have a sum of 70dB
